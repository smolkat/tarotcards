It can also be interpreted here that the magician symbolizes the ability to act as a go-between between the world above and the contemporary, human world. On his table, the magician also wields all the suits of the tarot. This symbolizes the four elements being connected by this magician - the four elements being earth, water, air, and fire.

Jachin (right) is generally referred to as the Pillar of Establishment and Boaz (left) is the Pillar of Strength. The pillars also depict the duality of nature; masculine and feminine, good and evil, negative and positive.        The High Priestess's location between the two suggests that it is her responsibility to serve as a mediator between the depths of the reality. She is the third pillar - the path between. She believes that both pillars are equal and there is knowledge to be learned in both worlds. You will also notice that she wears the crown of Isis which can mean that she is a believer of magic. The high priestess wearing of the solar cross denotes that she is connected to the season of the earth and the earth itself. The crescent moon at her feet is seen also in many depictions of the Virgin Mary, and means that she has a complete grasp over her emotion and the pomegranates refer to the ambition of the priestess.",

There are things that cannot be moved by human will and action alone. When we do not let go, it can bring only more suffering, for you may blame yourself for actions that could not have altered the situation. When we learn to accept, we also learn to forgive ourselves.

The Temperance card implies that you have a clear vision and know what you want to achieve. This is an indication of higher learning, which is a critical attribute in the journey of life. It reflects that you have found peace with what you are doing and everything is unfolding as it ought to. The Temperance card, in relation to other people, shows that you are able to adapt and work in harmony with your community, your coworkers and your loved ones. Your calmness in all matters gives them comfort and puts them at ease. Temperance may also indicate a time to evaluate and re-examine the priorities you have chosen. This will help you create a balance between your outer and inner self. At the end of it all, you will find greater purpose and meaning in your actions, for her message is that we cannot live fully in either. ",

A Temperance in reversal may also be used as a warning;  if you take a certain path, it would lead to turbulence and excess. Lack of a long-term plan or vision may also be the Temperance reversal meaning. This creates a lack of purpose for you, leaving you feeling lopsided as you search here and there for what you should be doing. You must reflect and think carefully about what needs to change. Temperance reminds us that all things are only good in moderation, and that we must examine in which aspects of our lives we are breaking the balance.",

Both the man and the woman have horns, as if to show that the more time they spend with the Devil, the less human they become. The chains make it appear as though the devil has taken them captive. The man has a flame on his tail while a woman has a bowl of grapes on her tail, which symbolizes their addiction to power and finer things in life, respectively.

So, one has to be prepared to make the necessary changes that might initially seem painful to make the adjustments that will pay off in the end by being able to find your true self again. Self-assessment is called for in this case and the individual needs to take some time and list all of the things that they need to get rid of.

When it comes to your love life, your romantic relationship may be nearing its end.

Though the destruction will be painful, the humbleness resulting from it can bring us peace. What you relied on will no longer be there for you.

This may be an existing conflict or one that is brewing and may eventually blow up in one's face.

The five men may signify problems in a group of people who are not patient enough to listen to what anyone else is saying. They only want to be heard, and since none of the others will listen, they all argue at once. Much of this can be solved by the querent taking the first step to try and initiate communication in such a way that you suggest that everyone airs out what they have to say, one at a time. By doing this, you will be able to address the problem, and everyone will be heard. Meaning they’ll all be satisfied. The Five of Wands can also mean that you are or will be facing competition in an area that you are not used to. This can be at work or school where you will meet people with the same abilities as you who pose quite a challenge - leading to feelings of jealousy, greed, and envy.

In her right hand, she is holding her wand which is starting to blossom, and symbolizes life. In her positive aspects, the Queen of Wands can be associated with fidelity, sustenance, and warmth. Her hidden side is hinted at with the placement of the black cat at her feet, which is traditionally a symbol of witchcraft and occultism, but can also point at her ability to grasp with her deep intuition.",
        "upright_description": "In general, the Queen of wands in a reading meaning may depict a person of extreme focus and fiery passion. She is courageous and individualistic, though at times she may appear self-centered. They have a positive and an uplifting energy; they represent someone who is willing to be by your side and stand up for you. In terms of work, the Queen of wands signifies that you are planning to accomplish a significant amount of achievement in just a small amount of time. In the event that you are looking for a job, the appearance of this card may mean that a woman will play a major role in your career move. Generally speaking, in terms of your career, things are looking pretty good. The Queen of Wands in questions of love also sends a positive energy. For people who are searching for love, there is a possibility that you will find it soon. When it comes to your finances, there is a chance that you are being carried away on spending a significant amount of money. We advise you to keep your expenses on check, or you will regret it in the end. In terms of health and spirituality, the Queen of Wands meaning may pertain to a spiritual hunger, a quest, or a search for meaning.",
        "inverted_description": "Regardless of its position (upright or reversed) the Queen of Wands symbolizes fertility, and all the feelings, emotions, and aspects that it brings. It may mean that there is someone who needs your help right now. In terms of work, there is a probability that you will encounter obstacles that will hamper your progress. Do not mind these obstacles and continue doing your job as you see fit. To see this card may also be a reminder to adhere to your rational side - to balance your sometimes chaotic energy with clear though, and you will be more successful.",

His throne, as well as his cape, are decorated with the salamander and the lion, which are symbols of fire and strength. The salamander that is biting his tail represents the infinity as well as the overall drive to move through all obstacles. The robe is bright and orange resembling a flame, while the crown is shaped like a tongue of fire. Let’s go ahead and take a deeper look at the symbolism behind the King of Wands.",
        "upright_description": "The meaning of the upright position of the King of Wands represents pure energy. Unlike the other wands cards in the deck however, this particular one is not focused on pure creativity. Instead, this king is actually way more likely to take an idea and to decisively implement it himself. The King of Wands is a natural born leader of people, and he is also extremely capable. Once the king sets for himself a certain aim or a goal, he is going to conveniently stick to it in order to ensure that it becomes a reality. The King of Wands looks forward to all sorts of different challenges - whether great or small, for he gets a natural adrenaline rush associated with the solving of problems.",
        "inverted_description": "The negative aspect of the card is associated, as you may guess, with a feeling of arrogance. He can even be rather aggressive in the actual pursuit of his goals, regardless of whether he’s actually conscious or not of it. He wouldn’t show restraint, nor even the humbleness to know when his assistance isn’t actually required. When reversed, the card depicts a personality which is prone to taking rash, impulsive and hasty decisions. This person could be pushy, overbearing as well as dominating at times. Even though he might rarely do this with a sense of malice or with an intention to make someone feel submissive, this is without a doubt a part of his character that one can be frustrated at. In reversal, the card represents the worst spectrum of the qualities of the fire – selfishness and ruthlessness. He can be manipulative as long as you are serving his purpose. With this in mind, the card definitely points out strong and weak aspects, and reflecting on his image can help you dig deeper in your personality. ",

These five streams represent the power of intuition and show the importance of listening to your inner voice. In order to obtain the kind of emotional or spiritual fulfillment that is depicted in the Ace of Cups, the querent will need to follow this inner voice, and remain true to it, regardless of the situation. This will require emotional discipline, but the rewards that this can bring are hinted at within the card itself: overflowing joy and happiness.",

The Ace of Cups may come to a reading after a long period of being lonely or enduring something that deeply hurt you emotionally, and it's appearance may be there to herald the turning over a new leaf. It is important for one to open themselves to more opportunities for friendships, love and spiritual learnings.

Seeing the Ace of Cups upside down during your reading means you have been enduring emotional instability or pain for some time. There is a loss that is indicated here, and perhaps something that has meant much to you is no longer giving you the joy that it once had. Since the cups also govern creativity, you may also be experiencing a creative block of sorts, and where the waters of inspiration once flowed, they have now dried up. In all these cases you must examine who or what is in control of the cup - which party allowed it to overturn? What can you do to place it right side up again?",

A strong pair is indicated here, the joy of two becoming one. When it comes to work, you may notice that the people around you will start to appreciate you more.

In terms of love, the card represents commitment, a balanced relationship, and love. But this does not simply mean that you will no longer need to nurture your love to make it last. The card only signifies that true love and affection is present. In your finances, the Two of Cups is associated with fairness and balance. This means that you are currently financially capable and you have the right amount of money to deal with your obligations. In relation with your health, people who are currently facing some health issues need to look for a practitioner that they will be comfortable working with and whom they can trust.

You may be finding that certain small details that were not problems before are coming into play, signaling that one party may have resentments. A line of communication that allowed you and the other party to openly talk about disagreements has been cut off, only worsening the cycle of resentment and imbalance. Be the first to open up, and you may find the problem much easier to repair than you thought it would be.",

As time passes, you may find that you are growing apart from one another. When we grow older, we must put in effort to make sure that our friendships are not neglected.

The man has crossed his hand and legs, and he is looking down at the three cups, unimpressed, such that he cannot see the cup being presented to him by the stretched arm.

You must search your motives, instincts and thoughts so that you can find your passion again. The Four of Cups revolves around finding your true interests and working towards fulfilling them.

The children seem to be in a castle of sorts, that we can imagine give them a sense of security and comfort.",

It can stand for you wanting to return to a happier time, whether it was when you were a child, teenager, or young adult. Many times, these memories are things of the past, which reflect the aspects of ourselves that have vanished. You may feel that remembering these times is the only way to feel happy. The Six of Cups appearing in a reading seems to indicate that while we may look upon the past with a happy eye, we must avoid living in it. The Six of Cups can also mean that you are be returning to a familiar place. This could be your hometown, an old friend’s home, a school, or any place that holds a lot of meaning for you. You are seeking to reconnect with people from your past. Bringing back old memories reminds us of our childhood, a time when things were simpler. Coming after the Five of Cups, this card can also suggest that you may have suffered a loss or disappointment of sorts, and you are making the journey home. You are looking to the past to find the answer to the crisis or challenge that you are facing now. You may be seeking the comfort and warmth of people that unconditionally love you, gathering strength to face the trials that are in front of you.",

Learn to focus on the present, and truly be aware. Another reading of the Six of Cups reversed is that you may feel as though you are disconnected from your childhood self, and that child's dreams, which may sometimes be unrealistic. Not reaching these goals can be painful, but sometimes reality carves a path for you that you must follow, and you shouldn't blame yourself for your choices. Take the time to think about where you want to be now and how you can reach your goals, instead of just dreaming about them.",
